# Part 4 - LUKSO Network Setup

## About

LUKSO uses the same software and architecture of Ethereum and will launch completely transitioned to proof-of-stake. It will resemble a post-merge Ethereum, commonly referred to as Ethereum 2.0 but no longer technically correct as the Ethereum foundation has moved away from that term.

### Nodes

A node is a computer running client software that can establish connections and exchange information with other nodes, forming a peer-to-peer network. A LUKSO node (like Ethereum) is the combination of two pieces of client software. The execution client processes transactions and smart contracts, while the consensus client coordinates the proof-of-stake consensus and runs the beacon chain. Running a node allows for the trustless and private use of the LUKSO network while supporting the network and ecosystem at the same time. Anyone with proper hardware can run a node; it does not require a stake.

### Validators

A validator consists of a LUKSO node and a third piece of client software responsible for proposing blocks. A financial stake is required to run a validator. Validators are rewarded for proposing blocks that help the network reach consensus and penalized for actions that hinder consensus, like being offline or acting maliciously.

## Before you begin

Make sure you did prepare your system in step 1, 2 and 3 of this guide first.

## Mainnet

Coming soon.

## Testnet

Follow the official LUKSO instructions to setup your Testnet node [here](https://docs.lukso.tech/networks/testnet/parameters/). Proceed to step 5 of this guide after.
