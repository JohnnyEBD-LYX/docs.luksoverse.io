# 1. Hardware and Build Process

This section of the guide is about building your blockchain node from scratch. Building a custom node can be an exciting and rewarding experience, as it allows you to take an active part in the world of decentralized networks while tailoring the hardware to your specific needs.

In this guide, I will walk you through my entire process, from selecting the components including router and network properties, to assembling and configuring the node for optimal performance.
